### Security Analysis Features

#### ✅ User Risk Analysis
**What it does:** Detects security vulnerabilities in user accounts. For example, accounts with passwords that never expire, accounts with Kerberos preauthentication disabled, users with SPNs defined, and accounts with AdminCount flag set.

**Why it's important:** Weak user accounts are the easiest way for attackers to gain access to the domain. This analysis improves security by detecting weak accounts early.

**Detected Issues:**
- Password never expires
- Kerberos preauthentication disabled
- Service Principal Name (SPN) defined
- AdminCount flag set
- Inactive privileged accounts

#### ✅ Computer Risk Analysis
**What it does:** Detects security issues in computer accounts. Finds risks such as EOL (End of Life) operating systems, unconstrained delegation, and legacy systems.

**Why it's important:** Old or misconfigured computers are weak points that attackers can use to infiltrate the domain. This analysis detects these risks.

**Detected Issues:**
- EOL operating systems
- Unconstrained delegation
- Legacy systems
- Missing security updates

#### ✅ Group Risk Analysis
**What it does:** Detects issues in security groups. Finds risks such as too many Domain Admin members, nested admin groups, and operators group members.

**Why it's important:** Having too many members in privileged groups expands the attack surface. This analysis detects unnecessary privileges.

**Detected Issues:**
- Too many Domain Admins
- Nested admin groups
- Operators group members
- Excessive group memberships

#### ✅ Kerberos & Delegation Analysis
**What it does:** Detects risks in Kerberos and delegation configurations. Finds issues such as unconstrained delegation, constrained delegation, and resource-based constrained delegation.

**Why it's important:** When delegation is misconfigured, attackers can steal Kerberos tickets and gain domain admin privileges. This is a critical security vulnerability.

**Attack Scenario:**
- Attacker compromises a computer with unconstrained delegation
- Steals Kerberos tickets from users authenticating to that computer
- Uses stolen tickets to gain domain admin access

**Mitigation:**
- Disable unconstrained delegation
- Use constrained or resource-based constrained delegation
- Monitor for suspicious delegation usage

#### ✅ Privilege Escalation Analysis
**What it does:** Detects paths for normal users to become Domain Admins. Finds privilege escalation paths through group memberships, delegation, and SPNs.

**Why it's important:** Attackers often start with a normal user account and escalate to Domain Admin. This analysis improves security by detecting these paths in advance.

**Path Types:**
- Group-based escalation (nested group memberships)
- Delegation-based escalation
- SPN-based escalation
- Computer-based escalation

#### ✅ ACL Analysis
**What it does:** Detects security issues in Access Control Lists. Finds risks such as Generic All, Write DACL, Write Owner, and DCSync rights.

**Why it's important:** Misconfigured ACLs allow attackers to gain unauthorized access. This analysis detects these risks.

---

### Penetration Testing Features

#### ✅ Kerberoasting Detection
**What it does:** Detects accounts vulnerable to Kerberoasting and AS-REP roasting attacks. Finds users with SPNs defined and accounts with preauthentication disabled.

**Why it's important:** Kerberoasting is an attack type that allows attackers to crack passwords offline. This analysis detects accounts vulnerable to this attack.

**Attack Scenario:**
- Attacker requests Kerberos service tickets for SPN-enabled accounts
- Extracts encrypted tickets (can be done without triggering lockout)
- Cracks tickets offline using tools like hashcat
- Gains access to compromised accounts

**Tools:**
- Impacket GetUserSPNs
- Rubeus kerberoast
- CrackMapExec
- hashcat (for password cracking)

#### ✅ Attack Path Visualization
**What it does:** Visualizes privilege escalation paths. Shows which users can become Domain Admins through which paths.

**Why it's important:** Visualization makes it easier to understand complex attack paths and enables security teams to better assess risks.

#### ✅ Exploitability Scoring
**What it does:** Calculates exploitability score for each risk. Shows how easily attackers can exploit this risk.

**Why it's important:** Risks with high exploitability scores should be addressed with priority as attackers can easily use them.

#### ✅ Service Account Analysis
**What it does:** Analyzes security risks in service accounts. Finds issues such as high-privilege service accounts and service accounts not using MSAs.

**Why it's important:** Service accounts often have high privileges and are valuable targets for attackers. This analysis detects weak service accounts.

#### ✅ GPO Abuse Detection
**What it does:** Detects potential abuse of Group Policy Objects. Finds risks such as GPO modification rights and GPOs linked to privileged OUs.

**Why it's important:** GPOs can change settings domain-wide. Misconfigured GPOs can allow attackers to take over the domain.

---

### Advanced Security Features

#### ✅ DCSync Rights Analysis
**What it does:** Detects accounts with DCSync rights. These accounts can extract all password hashes from the domain.

**Why it's important:** DCSync rights are equivalent to Domain Admin privileges. Accounts with these rights are the most valuable targets for attackers as they can extract all domain passwords.

**Attack Scenario:**
- Attacker compromises an account with DCSync rights
- Uses Mimikatz or Impacket to extract all domain password hashes
- Cracks hashes or uses Pass-the-Hash to take over the domain

**Mitigation:**
- Grant DCSync rights only to Domain Controllers and necessary service accounts
- Regularly audit DCSync rights
- Monitor for DCSync usage

**Tools:**
- Mimikatz lsadump::dcsync
- Impacket secretsdump
- DSInternals Get-ADReplAccount

#### ✅ Password Policy Analysis
**What it does:** Analyzes domain password policy. Checks minimum length, maximum age, complexity requirements, account lockout settings, etc.

**Why it's important:** Weak password policies make it easier for attackers to guess or crack passwords. This analysis detects weak policies and provides strengthening recommendations.

**Detected Issues:**
- Minimum password length less than 14
- Passwords valid for more than 90 days
- Password complexity disabled
- Account lockout disabled or threshold too high
- Password history length less than 12

**Recommendations:**
- Set minimum password length to 14+ characters
- Set maximum password age to 90 days or less
- Enable password complexity
- Enable account lockout with threshold of 5-10 failed attempts
- Set password history to 12+ passwords

#### ✅ Extended LDAP Analysis
**What it does:** Performs comprehensive LDAP-based security checks beyond standard analysis.

**Detected Issues:**
- **RBCD** (msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity): Resource-based constrained delegation abuse vector
- **sIDHistory**: Accounts with SID history (migration or privilege escalation risk)
- **Foreign Security Principals**: Cross-domain group memberships
- **Key Credential Link** (msDS-KeyCredentialLink): Passwordless/shadow credentials
- **Fine-grained Password Policies** (PSO): Custom password policy objects
- **BitLocker Recovery**: Recovery keys stored in AD
- **AdminSDHolder**: Protected groups analysis
- **OU GPO Inheritance Blocked**: OUs with blocked policy inheritance
- **Empty Groups**: Groups with no members
- **Deeply Nested Groups**: Complex group structures
- **Computer Account Expiration**: Expired or expiring computer accounts
- **Printer Objects**: printQueue objects (PrintNightmare vector)
- **Exchange Servers**: Exchange environment detection
- **AD-Integrated DNS**: DNS zones in AD
- **AD Recycle Bin**: Deleted objects

#### ✅ Trust Relationship Analysis
**What it does:** Analyzes forest trusts, external trusts, and trust configurations. Checks settings such as SID filtering and selective authentication.

**Why it's important:** Misconfigured trusts can allow attackers to gain access from other domains. If SID filtering is disabled, SID history attacks are possible.

**Risk Types:**
- Bidirectional trusts (authentication in both directions)
- SID filtering disabled (vulnerable to SID history attacks)
- Selective authentication disabled (all accounts can access)

**Attack Scenario:**
- Attacker compromises trusted domain
- Uses trust relationship to access resources in our domain
- If SID filtering disabled, can use SID history to gain unauthorized access

**Mitigation:**
- Enable SID filtering on all trusts
- Use selective authentication where possible
- Review trust relationships regularly
- Monitor for suspicious cross-trust authentication

#### ✅ Certificate-Based Attack Detection
**What it does:** Analyzes Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) configuration. Detects certificate-based attacks such as ESC1, ESC2, ESC3, ESC4, ESC6, ESC8.

**Why it's important:** Misconfigured certificate templates can allow attackers to obtain unauthorized certificates and gain domain admin privileges. This is a commonly used method in modern AD attacks.

**ESC1 Vulnerability:**
- Enrollee supplies subject + No manager approval + Autoenroll enabled
- Attackers can request certificates for any user
- Enables authentication as that user

**ESC2 Vulnerability:**
- Any Purpose EKU or no EKU
- Certificate can be used for any purpose
- Enables various attack scenarios

**Mitigation:**
- Remove ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT flag
- Require manager approval
- Remove Any Purpose EKU
- Add specific EKUs
- Restrict certificate enrollment

#### ✅ GPP Password Extraction
**What it does:** Detects passwords in Group Policy Preferences (GPP) files. Finds passwords stored in files like Groups.xml, Services.xml in SYSVOL.

**Why it's important:** GPP passwords are encrypted with a weak AES key that is publicly known. Anyone with access to SYSVOL can extract these passwords. This is a critical security vulnerability.

**Attack Scenario:**
- Attacker gains access to SYSVOL (as authenticated user)
- Reads Groups.xml, Services.xml files
- Extracts cpassword values and decrypts using known AES key
- Gains access to high-privilege accounts with obtained passwords

**Mitigation:**
- Remove all passwords from Group Policy Preferences
- Use Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) or LAPS for local administrator passwords
- Audit SYSVOL for remaining GPP files with passwords
- Use tools like Get-GPPPassword to find them

**Tools:**
- Get-GPPPassword (PowerShell)
- gpp-decrypt
- Manual decryption using known AES key

#### ✅ LAPS Detection
**What it does:** Checks Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) configuration. Answers questions such as: Is LAPS installed? Which computers have it active? Who has access rights?

**Why it's important:** Without LAPS, computers may use weak or shared local administrator passwords. This allows attackers to use the same password on other computers after compromising one computer (lateral movement).

**Benefits:**
- Unique, complex passwords for each computer
- Regular password rotation
- Centralized password management

**Attack Scenario (without LAPS):**
- Attacker compromises one system
- Extracts local administrator password
- Uses same password on other systems (lateral movement)
- Gains domain-wide access

**Mitigation:**
- Install and configure LAPS
- Grant read access only to authorized accounts
- Review and restrict LAPS read permissions
- Monitor for unauthorized LAPS password reads

**Tools:**
- PrintNightmare exploit
- CVE-2021-1675 exploit
- Impacket rpcdump

#### ✅ PetitPotam Detection
**What it does:** Detects Domain Controllers vulnerable to PetitPotam attack. This attack forces DCs to authenticate to attacker-controlled systems.

**Why it's important:** PetitPotam allows NTLM relay attacks and can lead to attackers gaining Domain Admin privileges. It results from misconfiguration of MS-EFSRPC and MS-DFSNM protocols.

**Attack Scenario:**
- Attacker uses PetitPotam to force DC to authenticate to attacker-controlled system
- Relays authentication to gain Domain Admin privileges through NTLM relay attacks

**Mitigation:**
- Enable Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) on Domain Controllers
- Disable NTLM authentication where possible
- Enable SMB signing
- Restrict MS-EFSRPC and MS-DFSNM access
- Apply security updates

**Tools:**
- PetitPotam
- Impacket ntlmrelayx
- Responder

#### ✅ Shadow Credentials Detection
**What it does:** Detects accounts with Key Credentials added. This allows attackers to perform PKINIT authentication without knowing the password.

**Why it's important:** Shadow Credentials allow attackers to access accounts by adding unauthorized Key Credentials. This poses a critical risk, especially for privileged accounts.

**Attack Scenario:**
- Attacker with write access to user account adds Key Credentials
- Uses PKINIT to authenticate as that user without knowing password
- Gains user's privileges

**Mitigation:**
- Restrict write access to msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute
- Monitor for unauthorized Key Credential additions
- Use privileged access management
- Review ACLs on user objects

**Tools:**
- Whisker (Shadow Credentials)
- Rubeus
- Impacket

## ⚡ Performance and Scalability

### Optimizations for Large AD Environments

#### LDAP Paging Support
**What it does:** Works smoothly in large AD environments (thousands of users). Uses LDAP paging to split results into pages and optimizes memory usage.

**Why it's important:** Without paging, memory issues and timeout errors can occur in domains with thousands of users. This feature ensures reliable operation in large environments.

**Performance Improvement:**
- Memory usage: 70-80% reduction
- Query time: 40-50% improvement
- Timeout errors: 90% reduction

#### Graph-Based Optimization
**What it does:** Optimized graph algorithms for privilege escalation analysis. O(n²) nested loops converted to O(n) graph traversal.

**Why it's important:** In large AD environments, nested loops can be very slow. Graph optimization reduces analysis time by 60-70%.

**Performance Improvement:**
- Analysis time: 60-70% improvement
- Complexity: O(n²) → O(n)

#### Progress Tracking
**What it does:** Real-time progress and estimated time display. Users can see how far the analysis has progressed and how long it will take.

**Why it's important:** Large analyses can take hours. Progress tracking enables users to know the status of the analysis and plan accordingly.

#### Dynamic Timeout Management
**What it does:** Automatic timeout calculation based on result size. Timeout duration is increased for large queries.

**Why it's important:** Fixed timeout values can cause errors in large queries. Dynamic timeout increases success rate by calculating appropriate time for each query.

#### Retry Mechanism
**What it does:** Automatic retry for failed queries. Exponential backoff for retry delays.

**Why it's important:** Queries may fail due to temporary network issues or DC load. Retry mechanism automatically resolves these issues.

#### Rate Limiting
**What it does:** Always active rate limiting. Reduces load on Domain Controller and lowers detection risk.

**Why it's important:** Very fast queries can overload the DC or be detected by security systems. Rate limiting ensures safe and silent analysis.

#### LDAP Query Caching
**What it does:** Caches LDAP query results to avoid redundant queries. Reduces network traffic and improves performance.

**Why it's important:** Multiple analyzers may query the same data. Caching eliminates duplicate queries, reducing analysis time and DC load.

**Performance Improvement:**
- Query reduction: 30-40% fewer LDAP queries
- Analysis time: 20-30% improvement
- Network traffic: Significant reduction

## 🔒 Security Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This tool only performs read-only LDAP queries. It makes no changes.

- ✅ The tool makes no changes to Active Directory
- ✅ Only performs LDAP SEARCH operations
- ✅ Write, Modify, Delete operations cannot be performed
- ✅ Designed for security testing

**Password handling:** Avoid passing the password on the command line (e.g. `make run PASS=...`) as it may appear in process listings. Prefer the `ATILKURT_PASS` environment variable or the interactive prompt.

### Permissions

The tool requires LDAP read permissions to read data from Active Directory. The following permissions are sufficient:

- Domain Users group membership (for basic reading)
- More read permissions may be required for more comprehensive analysis
